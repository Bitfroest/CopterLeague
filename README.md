# CopterLeague

CopterLeague is a web service written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). This platform gives an overview of all FPV Multirotor events in Germany and administers events and participants. The organisators can publish their official or inofficial competitions with additional information. The pilots then can register for a race and afterall the results of each race are uploaded. So we are able to create an overall pilot ranking from Germany.
